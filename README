Monome classes for SuperCollider. c

classes/  - contains .sc files, must live in your SC extensions path
examples/ - contains executable .scd code, can live anywhere you like

these classes implement communication with Monome devices using the serialosc 1.0 protocol.

the goal is to make a flexible and robust system along the lines of MIDIClient and MIDIResponder.

mostly, this works.
it is possible to create event responders matching arbitrary ports/devices/configurations/OSC patterns.
these responders have priority ordering and event swallowing.
the MonomeClient seems to be acceptably graceful when stealing or restoring devices from/to other apps.

however, there are major snags concerning SC's and serialosc's different attitudes towards zeroconf services,
resulting in some extremely ugly code in MonomeClient methods.

there is also some work to be done on robust plug-and-play methods with multiple applications and devices,
and on support for remotely-hosted devices.
